In my internships and work, I focus on heterogeneous computing and have developed TensorFlow to TensorRT converters, graph optimisation tools, hand-written cuda operator libraries, inference embedding cache on GPU and TensorRT-based backend inference engines for large-scale advertising systems.  
I have a strong interest in operating systems, compilers, and high performance computing.  
I'm a Vimer, Linux user, open source enthusiast.
